synopsis: a "Desktop Workflow" monad with Objective-C bindings 
description:
  a \"Desktop Workflow\" monad with Objective-C bindings. 
  . 
  includes bindings to: 
  .
  * press keys with modifiers
  . 
  * get/set the clipboard
  . 
  * launch/focus applications
  . 
  * get the name of the current application 
  .
  * open URLs 
  .
  for example: 
  . 
  > -- | cut the currently highlighted region
  > cut :: (MonadWorkflow m) => m String
  > cut = do
  >  sendKeyChord [CommandModifier] XKey
  >  delay 250
  >  getClipboard
  .
  > -- | transform the currently highlighted region, via the clipboard
  > transformClipboard :: (MonadWorkflow m) => (String -> String) -> m () 
  > transformClipboard f = do
  >  contents <- cut
  >  setClipboard (f contents) 
  >  sendKeyChord [CommandModifier] VKey
  . 
  see @Workflow.OSX@ for several more examples
